    "$RIVN this company reminds me of Tesla in 2020-2021 so much. It wouldn’t make that big move due to supply chain issues, not being able to meet demand, insane demand and no supply. When musk himself said “the stock is to expensive”. The company turned around, fixed its issues and became a Goliath. I work in Beverly Hills and see Rivians more than teslas. Although Rivian may just be a laggard in the space, they do have the opportunity to take market share from Tesla. At this valuation, what’s stopping $AAPL from buying them out?",
